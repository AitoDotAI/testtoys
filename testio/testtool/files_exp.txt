file(filename) can be used to get names for files in test directory
each test case has its very own directory, where file are written.

let's create a file
this file has name test.txt
path is /home/arau/arau/work/libraries/texttest/testio/testtool/files/test.txt
path may vary, so we printed it with iln(str)

let's write content in the file.
you can easily feed the file back to test tool for testing.
file content is this:

lorem ipsum
foo bar

if the content changes, the test will break.
